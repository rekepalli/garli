**This is the location of the latest versions of GARLI!**

GARLI, Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference is a program for inferring phylogenetic trees.  Using an approach similar to a classical genetic algorithm, it rapidly searches the space of evolutionary trees and model parameters to find the solution maximizing the likelihood score.  It implements nucleotide, amino acid and codon-based models of sequence evolution, and runs on all platforms.  The latest version adds support for partitioned models and morphology-like datatypes.  It is written and maintained by Derrick Zwickl.

**July 2013 - Garli Version 2.01 has been released.  This is a minor bug-fix update to version 2.0 (released April 2011).  Multithreaded executables are not yet available, but continued use of version 2.0 should be fine in nearly all cases.  Get it on the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/garli/downloads/list) page.**

GARLI 2.0 is first "official" release including partitioned models.  It is a merging of official release 1.0 and beta version GARLI-PART 0.97. Version 2.0 should replace earlier versions, and should be backwards compatible with all configuration files and datasets that were used with either Version 1.0 or GARLI-PART 0.97.

Documentation of features specific to Version 2.0 is currently being worked on, and will appear on the support wiki.
